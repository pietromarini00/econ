My group and I elaborated a simple linear regression model to estimate the parameters of the Phillips Curve, expressing the relation between unemployment and expectation in inflation. 
Then we tried to reach a higher precision in the prediction of the target variable by considering other variables that might affect expected inflation such as the 10year yield on government bonds, the price of oil (imported), and other economically sensible and statistically relevant variables
